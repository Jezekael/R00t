## 🧪 Hacking Stuff

Just a place where I drop scripts, tools and random code I make while practicing ethical hacking.  
Some things might be broken, messy, or unfinished — that's the point.

### 🗃️ Contents

- 🕵️ Recon tools  
- 💣 Exploit scripts  
- 🔍 Vulnerability scanners  
- 📦 Payload generators  
- 📁 Anything else I find useful  

If it helps you, cool. If not, that’s fine too.

### 📎 Note

This is all for **educational purposes only**. Don’t be dumb.

### 💻 To-Do (maybe)

- Clean stuff up  
- Add more examples  
- Actually finish something

### 🧃 That's it.
